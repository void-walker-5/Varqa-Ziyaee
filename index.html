    Tehran is the capital of Iran and Tehran Province. With a population of around 8.7 million in the city and 15
    million in the larger metropolitan area of Greater Tehran, Tehran is the most populous city in Iran and Western
    Asia, and has the second-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East, after Cairo). It is ranked 24th in the
    world by metropolitan area population. It is also known for its sprawling development and futuristic architecture,
    epitomized by the Milad Tower and the Fereshteh Pasargad Hotel, designed by Zaha Hadid.
    In the Classical era, part of the territory of present-day Tehran was occupied by Rhages, a prominent Median city
    destroyed in the medieval Arab, Turkic, and Mongol invasions. Modern Ray is urban area absorbed into the metropolitan
    area of Greater Tehran.

  <p style="background-color: darkolivegreen" class="box">
  Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty in 1786, because of its
  proximity to Iran's territories in the Caucasus, then separated from Iran in the Russo-Iranian Wars, to avoid the
  vying factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties. The capital has been moved several times throughout
  history, and Tehran is the 32nd national capital of Persia. Large-scale demolition and rebuilding began in the 1920s,
  and Tehran has been a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century.
  </p>
  <p style="background-color: darkred" class="box">
  Tehran is home to many historical locations, including the royal complexes of Golestan, Sa'dabad, and Niavaran, where
  the two last dynasties of the former Imperial State of Iran were seated. Tehran's most famous landmarks include the
  Azadi Tower, a memorial built under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1971 to mark the 2,500th
  anniversary of the founding of the Imperial State of Iran, and the Milad Tower, the world's sixth-tallest
  self-supporting tower, completed in 2007, and the Tabiat Bridge, completed in 2014.
  Most of the population are Persian, and roughly 99% of them understand and speak the Persian language, but
  large populations of other ethno-linguistic groups live in Tehran and speak Persian as a second language.

    Various theories on the origin of the name Tehran have been put forward.<br>
    Iranian linguist Ahmad Kasravi, in an article "Shemiran-Tehran", suggested that Tehran and Kehran mean "the warm
    place", and "Shemiran" means "the cool place". He listed cities with the same base and suffix and studied the
    components of the word in ancient Iranian languages, and came to the conclusion that Tehran and Kehran meant the
    same thing in different Iranian language families, as the constant "t" and "k" are close to each other in such
    languages. He also provided evidence that cities named "Shemiran" were cold, and those named "Tehran" or "Kehran"
    very hot. He considered other theories not considering ancient history of Iranian languages such as "Tirgan" theory
    and "Tahran" theory folk etymology.</p>
  <p>
    Another theory is that "Tehran" derives from Tiran/Tirgan, "the abode of Tir", the Zoroastrian equivalent of
    Hermes). The ancient Parthian town of Tiran had a neighbour, Mehran ("abode of Mehr/Mithra", the Zoroastrian sun
    god). Both of these were mere villages in the suburbs of the great city of Ray/Rhages. Mehran still exists as a
    residential district in Greater Tehran, as well as Ray, which forms the southern suburbs of Tehran.

    Tehran is in the historical Media region of in northwestern Iran. By the time of the Median Empire, part of
    present-day Tehran was a suburb of the prominent Median city of Rhages. In the Avesta's Videvdat (i, 15), Rhages is
  mentioned as the 12th sacred place created by Ohrmazd. In Old Persian inscriptions, Rhages appears as a
  province (Bistun 2, 10-18). From Rhages, Darius I sent reinforcements to his father Hystaspes, who was putting down a
    rebellion in Parthia (Bistun 3, 1-10). Some Middle Persian texts give Rhages as the birthplace of
    Zoroaster, although modern historians generally place the birth of Zoroaster in Khorasan Province.

    Mount Damavand, the highest peak of Iran, which is located near Tehran, is an important location in Ferdowsi's
    shahname, an Iranian epic poem based on the ancient legends of Iran. It appears in the epics as the
    homeland of the protoplast Keyumars, the birthplace of King Manuchehr, the place where King Fereydun bound the
    dragon fiend Azhdahak (Bivarasp), and the place where Arash shot his arrow.

    Growing awareness of civil rights resulted in the Constitutional Revolution and the first constitution of Iran in
    1906. On June 2, 1907, the parliament passed a law on local governance known as the Baladie (municipal law),
    providing a detailed outline on issues such as the role of councils within the city, the members' qualifications,
    the election process, and the requirements to be entitled to vote. The then-Qajar monarch Mohammad Ali Shah
    abolished the constitution and bombarded the parliament with the help of the Russian-controlled Cossack Brigade on
    June 23, 1908. That followed the capture of the city by the revolutionary forces of Ali-Qoli Khan (Sardar Asad II)
    and Mohammad Vali Khan (Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni) on July 13, 1909. As a result, the monarch was exiled and replaced
    with his son Ahmad, and the parliament was re-established.<br>

    After World War I, the constituent assembly elected Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty as the new monarch, who
    immediately suspended the Baladie law of 1907, replacing the decentralised and autonomous city councils with
    centralist approaches to governance and planning.
